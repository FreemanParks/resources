## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why
Web and mobile app to track the status of ventilator equipment in the public health care system and provide access to technical resources to help their maintenance.

Main functionalities:
- Ventilator Tracking Dashboard
- Ventilator Technical Resources (HowTo guides, list of manufacturers and specialists, etc.)

### 💥 Problem
Mechanical ventilation may be needed in the treatment of the more severe respiratory distress cases of the COVID-19 disease (https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov).
One major concern is the availability of proper patient care equipment in the worst-case scenario of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in the countries with low Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/universal-health-coverage-(uhc)).
Therefore, it is important to track the availability of this kind of equipment in a given geographic region, including their operational conditions.
If maintenance is needed, volunteers will need access to verified technical resources such as training and HowTo/DIY guides provided/reviewed by specialists to perform proper repair and safe deployment.
