*Introduction.*

These are the fundamental principles guiding selection criteria for official software projects under the Open Air Project.

*Fundamental criteria.*

1. Feasibility
• Human capital requirement
• Financial capital requirement
• Timeframe (incl. projected regulatory hurdles)
Selected projects must fit reasonably within each framework.

2. Scalability
• How easy is it for the project to grow?
• How many people/organizations can derive utility from this project?
Selected projects should be highly scalable, unless they have outsize impact (see below).

3. Impact
• How directly does the project address the COVID-19 pandemic?
• How significant is the problem being solved, and does the solution adequately solve it?
• What are the chances of this project having a significant impact on the pandemic?
Selected projects must be high-impact. Since we are allocating resources from other projects, 
the ones with the greatest probability of meaningful action must be given priority.
   
*Proposed assessment scale.*

Rate & review each proposal on an 80-point scale, then use community votes to select the top 5 proposals.

1. Feasiblity = 30 points total
• Human capital = 5 points—we have access to a fairly diverse talent pool, so this should hold less weight.
• Financial capital = 10 points—we have access to some funding sources, but exuberant fundraising may not prove possible.
• Timeframe = 15 points—the pandemic is spreading and every solution is needed ASAP, hence the most weight goes to timeframe a.k.a. time to deployment.

2. Scalability = 20 points total
• How easy is it to grow? = 10 points
• How many people/organizations derive utility = 10 points—both hold equal significance for scalability.
   
3. Impact = 50 points total
• How directly does project addresses COVID-19 = 10 points—implicit solutions can still succeed, just with lesser likelihood, so this should have reduced significance.
• Significance of problem being solved = 20 points
• Chances of this project having a significant impact on the pandemic = 20 points—both have equal significance in terms of net impact.
   
4. Votes
• Out of the top 10 projects by reviewer score, 5 will be selected base on community vote quantity. In the case of a tie, run a private vote among Software Leads.
