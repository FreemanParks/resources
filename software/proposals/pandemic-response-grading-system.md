## üìÉ Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why
 

### üí• Problem
Countries, states, provinces, etc. are all implementing various policies to slow the spread of COVID-19. Part of the problem I see with this is that there is a lack of feedback metrics to gauge the efficacy of these policies aside from COVID testing (something many countries have had issues with). For the engineers out there, a proper analogy is a feedback control system. i.e. there are "inputs" (social distancing, school closure, etc) that are trying to control a "plant/model" (social interaction, hygiene, etc.) to obtain a desired "output" (spread of COVID-19). The only feedback that communities seem to have is COVID-19 testing.

### üë®‚Äçüî¨Hypothesis
With more available feedback and metrics that quantify isolation quality, spread risk, etc., communities could better assess how well isolation/quarantine/distancing meassures are working prior to wide spread testing. Quality feedback = quicker convergence to desired results.   

### ü§î Assumptions
Data necessary is available and accurate enough to yield discernable metrics. 

## üíªImplementation Suggestion
The objective of this project would be to amalgamate multiple data sources to provide additional feedback metrics to communities to use in times of virus outbreaks (unfortunately COVID-19 will not be the last). Metrics such as community dispersion/clustering, peak travel times/rush hour, time spent in high infection risk areas (gyms, pools, close quarters markets, bars/clubs, etc.) This is similar to Mark Xu's google maps suggestion, but I'm broadening it to include any data source that could be accessed, obtained, scraped, mined, etc., with reasonable accuracy. 

### V1
This could be most easily accomplished with a web application since it would be primarily for data request, data processing and data display. There are obviously a number of subsystems within this idea. Subsystems and interfaces will be better defined if the project is selected and pursued. 

### What it is
A utility using publically (or private collaboration) accessible data sets to provide communities with insights about how their social distancing is working.   

### What it is not
A distributed application that relies on user engagement, opt-in, or precise tracking. 

### Design
I am no cloud architecture expert so stick with me here and please make suggestions.
* Front end could be a node.js web app hosted on AWS or cloud provider of choice. 
* Back end could be in something like EC2 with our scalable database of choice. This would have sub-systems responsible for:
    * Scraping and processing data 
    * Building upon the database 
    * Running continuous testing and modeling in the back end for major areas to continuously test operability. 
    * Serving user queries 


### Data/Experiments
I'll treat this section as a bench-mark list for data driven components
1. Historic v. Current Geographic Population Distribution 
    * Generate a visualization and metric for population dispersion and mobility over a fixed period and compare it with historical norms

2. Classification of High Exposure Risk Geographic Areas
    * Identify and categorize high exposure risk areas based on the venu genre and normal population density
        * e.g. We find "Foo Theater" and know that it's a movie theater that has approximately "bar" patrons per day in a tight space... seems risky
        * e.g. We find "Foo Park" and know it's a green space or nature preserve that has approximately "bar" patrons per day, but they're tyypically spread out: seems like less risk


## üí™ Impact of Potential Solution
Quality feedback = Faster convergence to desired results

## üôå Criteria for Success
# Data Success Criteria 
* Population locale data accuracy is sufficient relative to COVID-19 spreading. i.e. Given best known transmission models, errors are within **N** (ToDo) bars. 
* High risk location classifier has false positive rate lower than **N%** (ToDo)
* High risk location classifier has accuracy within **N%** (ToDo)
* Data biases are aknowledged and mitigated
