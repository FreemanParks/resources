## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

People who are at high risk from COVID-19 or are quarantined are unable to leave their houses and obtain necessities like food and medical supplies without putting themselves or others at risk. We aim to facilitate support requests for these people and act as a bridge between them and reputable volunteer organizations that can help, such as government organizations, churches and local Red Cross establishments. These organizations are all reputable and conduct the appropriate background checks on their volunteers to ensure that no foul play happens. After all, we’re trying to create a safe and familiar environment that people can count on.

More details. and information on how to get involved can be found on the

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis
