## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

## To be migrated from Google doc

### 💥 Problem

Help is needed with neighbourhood assistance, like we saw in Wuhan. Order and deliver supplies. Assist the elderly.
See: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQCywLH887-IzYAxvYp6REkH-uN9XBqZUPMVhWiEho0/edit#heading=h.q6nf55nbm8ll

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

Software to help people organize neighborhood assistance.

Aggregating volunteer organizations and queuing requests for assistance to create a clearinghouse so that the right resources get to the people most in need in the most efficient manner.

### 🤔 Assumptions

* Not needed for general neighbourhood help but will help if testing becomes available at some point
