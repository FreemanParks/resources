## Getting started

You don't need to do anything, this project is automatically built whenever you commit to `master`. (TODO)

1. A commit arrives on the `master` branch.
2. A CI job picks up this commit and runs the code in this branch.
3. The built HTML is commited to the `gh-pages` branch which is then served by Github Pages

## Development

Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) and [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com).

Open the project directory in your CLI and run the `yarn` command to install dependencies.

After that you can run any of following commands

```bash
# local development (localhost:8000)
yarn start

# storybook development (localhost:9000)
yarn start:storybook

# run eslint on project

# build site for deployment (/public)
